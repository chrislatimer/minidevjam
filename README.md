# Mini DevJam

Welcome to the Apigee mini hands on DevJam workshop.

# Getting Started

  In this workshop, you will get first hand exposure to Apigee Edge, the industry's leading API Management platform. To get started with Apigee Edge, you will need to create an account and set up a free trial instance of Apigee Edge that you can use to build our labs today.

  If you already have a trial account with Apigee, you can skip the following registration steps and use your existing instance. Access your Apigee instance by signing in here: <a href="https://apigee.com/edge" target="_blank">https://apigee.com/edge</a>.

   If you're new to Apigee, visit this page to create an account: <a href="https://apigee.com/edge" target="_blank">https://apigee.com/edge</a>

  You will be presented with a sign in form as shown here:

  Click on the _Activate your account_ link to be redirected to the Apigee sign in form. After signing in you will be presented with a number of options.
